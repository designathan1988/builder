// The CSS support port: whether the browser takes a value for a property. The core has no browser; a handler that
// writes a value a person typed (style.set, the number fields) asks this port before it writes, so the browser is the
// truth of what a value means (DESIGN.md "Inspector": a value the browser does not act on is never written). The editor
// gives the browser's own answer (src/editor/css-support.ts, CSS.supports); tests pass the answer they choose.
