// When a shortcut runs (DESIGN.md "Build order"), part of the keymap owner (ARCHITECTURE.md): its command is built,
// and its door's feature is the feature that introduces the command or is registered as built (the feature table,
// src/app/features.ts). A key has no drawing to say "not available yet", so the shortcut of a feature still to come
// does not run, while its command already runs through the doors of the feature that introduced it (the gradient
// editor's stop keys wait for the gradient editor, though props-background built the command they run). The keymap
// decides with this function, and the door census (tests/e2e/census.spec.ts) and the scenario runner import the same
// one, so it is pure: it runs in the editor and in Node.
export interface ShortcutFacts {
  readonly command: string;
  // the feature that introduces the command (its manifest `introducedBy`)
  readonly introducedBy: string;
  // the door's own feature
  readonly feature: string;
